/**
 * "Headless" card-creation helpers — entry points used when the user
 * long-presses any Add-to-Anki button, so a card lands without
 * passing through the review sheet. They layer **preloading awaits**
 * on top of [Context.sendSentenceCard] / [Context.sendWordCard]:
 * either reuse the data the caller hands them, or await the same
 * [LastSentenceCache] entries the review sheet would have observed.
 *
 * `oneTapSendWord` deliberately takes no sentence context: today's
 * word-card path discards sentence unless the user manually flips to
 * sentence mode inside the sheet, and `AnkiCardOutputBuilder.forWord`
 * hardcodes the SENTENCE / SENTENCE_TRANSLATION fields to "" anyway.
 * One-tap honors that — if the user wants sentence context, they
 * long-press to edit.
 *
 * These helpers do NOT show progress indicators, dismiss UI, or open
 * the mapping dialog — surface UX stays with the call site. Callers
 * launch in their own coroutine scope; cancelling the scope cancels
 * the pipeline cleanly.
 */

/**
 * Sentence one-tap. Awaits any in-flight translation / word-lookup
 * the caller didn't already have, then sends the card with the
 * user's saved audio prefs.
 *
 * Defaults mirror the review sheet exactly:
 *  - With a [targetWord] in the resolved lookup, that one word is
 *    the selected target and (if [Prefs.ankiWordAudioEnabled] is on)
 *    gets per-target-word audio. The lens / popup paths use this.
 *  - Without a [targetWord], NO words are selected — the card has
 *    the sentence + translation but no bolded target, matching what
 *    a freshly-opened sheet looks like on the result-screen flow
 *    before the user picks targets manually. No per-word audio is
 *    synthesized either.
 *
 * @param translation   pre-resolved sentence translation, or null to
 *   await via [LastSentenceCache.awaitOrStartTranslation]
 * @param wordsPayload  pre-resolved words + surface forms,
 *   snapshotted atomically (e.g. from a single
 *   [TranslationResultViewModel.WordLookupsState.Settled] read), or
 *   null to await via [LastSentenceCache.awaitOrStartWordLookups].
 *   The pair-shape matters: reading
 *   [LastSentenceCache.surfaceForms] separately races against
 *   live-mode rotating the cache between sentences, so callers
 *   MUST NOT split the read across two field accesses.
 * @param targetWord    when non-null and present in the lookup, the
 *   sole selected target on the card (drag-lens / word-popup)
