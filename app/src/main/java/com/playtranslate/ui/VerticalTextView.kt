     * cells into the padded area, stacked top-to-bottom and wrapping into
     * additional (right-to-left) columns.
     *
     * Height is satisfied by construction (rows are derived from the available
     * height), so the only free constraint is width — and the columns needed
     * to show every cell grow monotonically with cell size, so a binary search
     * on the width-fit predicate is valid. The upper bound is additionally
     * capped so a single cell never exceeds the box height.
     *
     * If even `minPx` cannot show every cell within the width, the size stays
     * at `minPx` and [Layout.cols] is capped to what the width holds — the
     * trailing (last-read) cells are dropped rather than drawn outside the box;
     * a box too narrow for even one column yields `cols == 0` (nothing but the
     * background renders). That invariant (rendered overlay never exceeds the
     * child bounds) is
     * load-bearing: pinhole detection and OCR masking key off the child's
     * layout rect, so overlay pixels drawn outside it would go untracked
     * (stale-pixel false changes) and unmasked (OCR re-reading its own text).
     *
     * The dropped tail is silent by design — an accepted limitation, not an
     * oversight. It is very rare (multi-column wrap already uses the full box
     * width, and 6sp cells are tiny) and mirrors the horizontal path's own
     * degradation at the same 6sp floor. An overflow marker (vertical ellipsis)
     * and box expansion were both considered and intentionally declined
     * (2026-06-06): expansion is inconsistent with the shrink-to-fit horizontal
     * boxes and would overrun neighbours/screen edges.
