/**
 * LRU cache of past translations keyed by the `(text, source, target)`
 * triple so cross-pair stale reads are impossible by construction. A
 * cached JA→EN gloss can never be served for a JA→ES lookup.
 *
 * The preferred backend's id (e.g. "deepl", "google-gtx", or "none"
 * — sourced from [com.playtranslate.translation.TranslationBackendRegistry.preferredOnlineId])
 * is tracked separately via [reconcilePreferredBackend]. A backend
 * toggle clears the cache so the newly-preferred backend's translations
 * aren't shadowed by whatever was cached under the old preference.
 * Pair changes are NOT handled here — the key does that job.
 *
 * Not thread-safe. [com.playtranslate.CaptureService] mutates exclusively
 * from its `serviceScope` (Main-dispatched) with network calls dispatched
 * to IO via `withContext`, so read/write ordering on the cache is
 * implicitly serial.
