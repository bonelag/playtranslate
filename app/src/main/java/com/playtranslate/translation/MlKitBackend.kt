 * Offline ML Kit translation backend — the last resort in the waterfall.
 *
 * Delegates to [TranslationManagerProvider] so the dictionary / word-detail
 * path and the waterfall share one set of per-pair `TranslationManager`
 * (and thus underlying `Translator`) instances. [TranslationManagerProvider.getOrCreate]
 * is the pure-infrastructure entry point with no en-null policy.
 *
 * Model download is performed lazily on the first translate() call for a
 * given pair via [com.playtranslate.TranslationManager.ensureModelReady].
 * If the model isn't available and can't be downloaded, the call throws —
 * which is the right thing for a waterfall last-resort: surfacing the
 * failure to the caller is preferable to a silent fire-and-forget warm
 * that swallows download errors.
