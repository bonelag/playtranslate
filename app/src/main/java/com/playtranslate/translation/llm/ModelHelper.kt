/**
 * Manifest-backed paths and integrity helpers for an on-device LLM model.
 *
 * Implementations are typically `object`s (one per model). The catalog entry
 * (`langpack_catalog.json`) is the source of truth for URL, expected size,
 * SHA-256, and license attribution. The existence of [file] at the catalog's
 * expected size is the source of truth for "is this model installed?" — and
 * that file only appears after SHA-256 verification, because the downloader
 * writes incoming bytes to [partialFile] and atomically renames to [file] only
 * after the hash matches. We deliberately do not track install state in prefs
 * so a manual `rm` leaves no stale "installed" indicator.

     * absolute path of the *extracted root directory* containing the model's
     * loose files (e.g. MNN's `llm.mnn`, `llm.mnn.weight`, `config.json`).
     * The downloader's zip-extract path writes a `.sentinel` file inside this
     * directory containing the catalog SHA-256 after a verified successful
     * extract; [isInstalled] checks that sentinel rather than a single-file
     * size, since the catalog `size` is the *zip's* size, not the extracted
     * footprint.
