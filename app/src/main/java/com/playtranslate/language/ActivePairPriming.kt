/**
 * Best-effort provisioning of the offline assets a *selected* (source, target)
 * pair needs beyond its dictionary/gloss packs: the offline translation
 * model(s) and the source's default OCR recognizer.
 *
 * Shared by [com.playtranslate.ui.LanguageSetupActivity]'s source-selection
 * flow and [PackUpgradeOrchestrator]'s post-upgrade priming so the two cannot
 * disagree on what "priming the active pair" means. That disagreement was a
 * real bug: a forced pack upgrade re-provisioned translation but silently
 * skipped OCR because the orchestrator hand-listed only the translation step.
 *
 * Both steps are best-effort and idempotent. Translation prefers Bergamot (the
 * default offline tier) and falls back to ML Kit for unsupported pairs or
 * download failures; OCR downloads the source's default recognizer and leaves
 * ML Kit as the floor on failure. Neither blocks the flow — the dictionary and
 * online backends don't depend on them. Cancellation propagates.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch dictionary/gloss packs or warm the source engine.
 * Those have call-site-specific lifecycles (install/swap with handle eviction,
 * preload with corrupt-pack rollback) and stay where they are.
 *
 * @param sourceId the selected source language (drives both the OCR recognizer
 *   and, via its [SourceLanguageProfiles] translation code, the translation
 *   models — e.g. Traditional Chinese resolves to "zh" for the Simplified-only
 *   Bergamot/ML Kit models).
 * @param ocrRequired when true, the source's OCR recognizer is mandatory (a
 *   no-floor language like Russian has no ML Kit fallback): if the pack isn't
 *   installed after the best-effort download, throw so the caller aborts the
 *   selection. Default false keeps OCR best-effort (the pack-upgrade path).
 * @return whether the offline translation path is ready (Bergamot loaded, or
 *   all ML Kit fallback models present). Callers surface this how they like —
 *   a toast in setup; logged-only during a pack upgrade.
