 *   paths via [com.playtranslate.language.PackIntegrity.isInside] before
 *   any disk write.
 * - [url] is the resolvable URL the downloader fetches from. Typically a
 *   HuggingFace `…/resolve/main/<path>` URL; LFS-backed files 302-redirect
 *   to the LFS CDN and OkHttp follows transparently.
 * - [size] is the expected byte length. Mismatch deletes the partial and
 *   returns `Outcome.Failed`.
 * - [sha256] is the expected hex SHA-256 (case-insensitive). Pinned so
 *   silent upstream rotation produces a clear download error.
 *
 * All four fields are required (declared non-null) but Gson reflection can
 * still populate nulls if a JSON entry omits a field. Downstream
 * validators (e.g. `HyMtModel.hasShippableCatalogEntry`) gate visibility
 * before any code touches these as non-null — same pattern the rest of
