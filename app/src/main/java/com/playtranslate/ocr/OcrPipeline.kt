/**
 * Orchestrates one OCR pass: preprocess → engine → shared layout. Engine- and
 * recipe-agnostic. Returns grouped paragraphs in the engine's INPUT coordinate
 * space, plus the [Output.scaleFactor] the caller uses to normalize boxes back
 * to original-bitmap coordinates. The caller ([com.playtranslate.OcrManager])
 * projects the groups into its `OcrResult` / `OcrLine` shapes — so both entry
 * points share one acquisition+layout path (no duplication).
 *
 * Preprocessing lives here, not in the engine, because the recipe is an
 * app-level, per-call concern (the golden sweep overrides it) and `ocr.core`
 * must not depend on `OcrPreprocessingRecipe`. Engines that self-preprocess
 * ([com.playtranslate.ocr.core.OcrCapabilities.selfPreprocesses] = true, e.g.
 * PaddleOCR) receive the original bitmap and report original coords
 * (scaleFactor = 1); the grouping kernel is ratio-based, so grouping is
 * identical regardless of which space it runs in.
