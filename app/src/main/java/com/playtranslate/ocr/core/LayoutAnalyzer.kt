/**
 * Shared, vendor-neutral layout logic for OCR.
 *
 * This object owns the **pure-geometry grouping kernel** — the carefully-tuned
 * predicates that decide whether two boxes belong to the same text block, plus
 * the one-pass clustering algorithm built on them. It is engine-agnostic: it
 * operates on `android.graphics.Rect` + injected `alignLefts` + orientation +
 * mode, with **no text content, no language, and no ML Kit / MNN / OpenCV
 * dependency**. Text-derived inputs (the hanging-punctuation align hint, the
 * source-script noise filter) are computed by the engine adapters and either
 * injected here as `alignLefts` or applied before/after these calls.
 *
 * This is what makes grouping shareable across all call sites:
 *  1. post-recognition layout for end-to-end engines (ML Kit lines → paragraphs),
 *  2. between detection and recognition (cluster detector boxes into bubbles —
 *     pure geometry, `alignLefts` all null, no text filter), and
 *  3. cross-frame region matching for overlay caching ([Classification]).
 *
 * The kernel was moved here verbatim from `OcrManager.Companion`; its behavior
 * is pinned by `OcrGroupingTest` (synthetic-Rect cases).

     * [aLineCount] / [bLineCount] tell the predicate how many text lines
     * each rect spans across the wrap axis (line count for horizontal,
     * column count for vertical). When passed, the reference dimension
     * (refH/refW) is computed as the rect's per-line height (or per-column
     * width) instead of its raw extent — so a 2-line group's height is
     * normalized to a single-line equivalent before gap/align/ratio
