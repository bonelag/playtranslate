 * Generic bilingual-dictionary result model. Originally modelled after the
 * Jisho REST API (which is why the shape still looks like a search response),
 * but now produced locally from the on-device dictionary database — nothing
 * here is parsed from JSON, so the old Gson `@SerializedName` annotations
 * have been dropped.
 *
 * These types are intended to be language-agnostic: a [Headword] can be a
 * Japanese kanji form, a Chinese simplified surface, or a Latin lemma;
 * [Sense.targetDefinitions] holds the glosses in the user's chosen target
 * language (English today).
